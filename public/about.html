<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m Samuel Azameti!</p>
<p>I’m a website developer who loves bringing ideas to life on the web. Whether it’s crafting a sleek business site, 
an interactive portfolio, or a dynamic web app, I focus on making each project clean, fast, and easy to use.</p>

<p>I mix creativity with problem-solving to make websites that not only look good but work perfectly on any device.
For me, it’s not just about coding—it’s about creating something people enjoy using.</p>

<p>When I’m not building websites, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech tools,
learning design tricks, or finding ways to make the internet a little more awesome.</p>
